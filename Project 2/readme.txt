Project team:
Jacob Kring - jak201
William Rossi - wjr18

Team workload:
We worked on this project equally. All contributions were made as a team, either with one member coding and the other helping or vice versa.

No changes were made to the Makefile. Our implementation does not have timeouts as a feature.
